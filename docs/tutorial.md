## Development Environment 

The Responsive Paper Service (RPS) uses headless chrome server side so it is advised to develop your reports using google chrome.  You will also need a development server installed such as http-server (npm http-server).

## Initial HTML Template

Clone the [Responsive Paper Examples repository](https://github.com/responsivepaper/examples) or make a copy of the starter template [index.html](https://github.com/responsivepaper/examples/tutorial/01/index.html) and the example [data.js](https://github.com/responsivepaper/examples/tutorial/01/index.html) .  This includes a link to the responsive-paper.designer.css file to help in building the layout for your reports.
