Responsive Paper is a revolutionary way to design and build pdf reports using pure html, javascript and css. No more
SSRS, Crystal Reports and all the frustrating limitations that those
frameworks provide.

* Use millions of js libraries for charting, etc
* Design once for multiple pdf paper sizes
* Many common formats supported (Letter, Legal, A6, A5, A4, A3, etc)
* Portrait or landscape orientaion
* Use different page formats and orientations in the same pdf
