# Introduction

Responsive Paper is a revolutionary way to design and build pdf reports using pure html, javascript, and css. It puts the ease of GUI report design into the hands of you as a developer. The Responsive Paper HTML to PDF API is an easy to use web service that renders web pages annotated with the [Responsive Paper CSS classes](css-reference?id=css-reference) and delivers the paginated view as a PDF document. The service utilizes the headless chrome browser rendering engine incorporating the latest rich html / css / js capabilities.

Some of the highlights of Responsive Paper include:

* Create pdf reports using your favorite client side html/js/css framework (e.g. Vue, React, etc)
* Use the latest css technologies and retain reprinting headers without using `<th>` tags and print media queries
* Use millions of js libraries for charting, etc
* Design once for multiple pdf paper sizes
* Many common formats supported (Letter, Legal, A6, A5, A4, A3, etc)
